    "If the composite system is defined using the density matrix $\\rho_{AB}$ AND we would like to describe the state of _**one**_ of the subsystems $A$, we define a partial trace over the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_B$ as $$\\mathrm{Tr}_B(\\rho_{AB}) \\equiv \\sum_i(I_{A} \\otimes \\bra{i}_{B})\\rho_{AB}(I_{A} \\otimes \\ket{i}_B)$$\n",
    "Since $\\ket{i}_B$ forms an orthnormal basis for Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_B$, the reduced density operator of $\\rho_A$ is defined as $$\\rho_A = \\mathrm{Tr}_B(\\rho_{AB})$$\n",
